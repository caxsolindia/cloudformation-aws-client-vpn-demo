# VPN Client Endpoint Setup Using Cloud Formation Script 
This project sets up a VPC with a VPN client endpoint using AWS CloudFormation. The VPC includes a public subnet with a NAT Gateway, and a private subnet.

# Prerequisites
Before getting started, you will need an AWS account and an understanding of AWS CloudFormation.

# Deployment
\ 1. Download the CloudFormation template file.
2. Open the AWS CloudFormation console. \
3. Create a new stack, and upload the CloudFormation template file. \
4. Fill in the required parameters for the stack, such as ServerCertificateArn and ClientCertificateArn. \
5. Wait for the stack creation to complete. This may take several minutes. \

# VPC Setup
The VPC includes a public subnet with a NAT Gateway, and a private subnet. The NAT Gateway allows the resources in the private subnet to access the internet.

# VPN Client Endpoint Setup
The VPN client endpoint allows secure access to the VPC resources from a remote client. The endpoint is configured to use certificate-based authentication, and authorizes all client groups to access the target network.

# To connect to the VPN client endpoint, follow these steps:

1. Open the OpenVPN client software. \
2. Import the client certificate file. \
3. Enter the endpoint URL and credentials. \
4. Connect to the VPN client endpoint. \

# Cleanup
To delete the resources created by this CloudFormation stack:

1. Open the AWS CloudFormation console. \
2. Select the stack. \
3. Click "Delete". \
4. Wait for the stack deletion to complete. This may take several minutes. \

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to set up a VPC with a VPN client endpoint using AWS CloudFormation. The endpoint allows secure access to VPC resources from remote clients, while the NAT Gateway provides internet access to private subnet resources. With this setup, you can securely access your VPC resources from anywhere in the world.
